# About

This repo is a scratchpad for the files and lessons learned from [React Fullstack with node/express, PostgresQl and AWS](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-fullstack-with-nodeexpress-psql-and-aws) on Udemy.

## Motivation

I learn by writing and blowing things up. All of my repositories that start with the word "learnings" are from tutorials or books I have read.

## Goals for Project

-   documenting things I learned so I can use them as resource later
-   Getting more practice with Hooks in React
-   Use Typescript in Node
-   Writing Tests for APIS in Mocha and Noe
-   Writing Unit tests for all node js
